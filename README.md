# Mr. Jason Oswald
## Chair of Computer Science, Germantown Academy

I am primarily concerned with developing Computer Science as a literacy for everybody.

My work exists in the following threads:
* Working with teachers of CS at all levels
* Developing (and implementing) curriculum that is modern, relevant, and accessible
* 

Eventually, this repository will contain a bunch of programming projects, certainly, but it will also contain a general framework for Computational Thinking that I have been developing for the past three years, along with a [collection of exercises](https://github.com/gajoswald/Computational-Thinking-Exercises) (lesson plans, if you will). The work is done (inasumuch as such work could ever be done), but coaxing it into a consistent, publishable form is not. 

Please connect with me @gajoswald
