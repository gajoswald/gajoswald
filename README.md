## Former Chair of Computer Science, Germantown Academy

_Aspirant, Optimist_

I am primarily concerned with developing Computer Science as a literacy for everybody.

My [Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ytFB8TrkTo) is I _believe_ that good education is everyone's right and I _know_ the way we do it can be better. 

My work exists in the following threads:
* Working with learners and teachers of CS at all levels
* Developing (and implementing) curriculum that is modern, relevant, and accessible
