# Mr. Jason Oswald
## Chair of Computer Science, Germantown Academy

I am primarily concerned with developing Computer Science as a literacy for everybody. Eventually, this repository will contain a bunch of programming projects, certainly, but it will also contain a general framework for Computational Thinking that I have been developing for the past three years, along with a collection of exercises (lesson plans, if you will). The work is done (inasumuch as such work could ever be done), but coaxing it into a consistent, publishable form is not.
